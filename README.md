This is how to set up and run “Rope Runners”

1.Download Raylib from the website “https://www.raylib.com” 

2.Once downloaded, extract the Raylib folder to a location on your computer.

3.Locate the Raylib folder and open the file directory where you extracted the Raylib folder then 
double click the “raylib” folder to open it.

4.Inside the “raylib” folder, find and open the “npp” folder then double click “notepad++.exe” to launch Notepad++ 
(this is the text and source code editor used to run the game, the Raylib package 
downloaded comes with a pre-configured setup that automates the compilation process
which means “gcc” commands aren't necessary for this process).

5.Once Notepad++ is opened, click “File” then “Open” and 
navigate to the “RopeRunners.c” source file included in this GitHub submission. Select it and click “Open”

6.Once the source code is successfully opened in Notepad++, press “F6” or “Fn + F6” (depending on the keyboard) 
and the execute window should pop up. 
Select the “raylib_compile_execute” option from the list then click “OK” compile and run the game. 
A window titled “Rope Runners” should open if it’s successful.

7.To close the game at any time, simply close the game window to end it.
